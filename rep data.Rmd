## Loading and preprocessing the data

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Show any code that is needed to

1 Load the data (i.e. read.csv())

```{r}
setwd("Y:/Mijn Documenten/R-cursus/data")
activity<- read.csv("activity.csv")
str(activity)
```

2 Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis

```{r}
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

1 Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```{r}
steps_per_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activity, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
hist(steps_per_day$steps, breaks = 25, main = "Total number of steps per day", xlab = "Steps per day")

```

2. Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
mean(steps_per_day$steps)
median(steps_per_day$steps)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

1. Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

```{r}
avg_steps_interval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, activity, mean)
plot(avg_steps_interval$interval, 
     avg_steps_interval$steps, 
     type='l', col=3, 
     main="Average number of steps per Interval", 
     xlab="5-minute Intervals", 
     ylab="Average number of steps")
```

2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
```{r}
avg_steps_interval$interval[which.max(avg_steps_interval$steps)]
```

## Imputing missing values

Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as NA). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.

1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)

```{r}
sum(is.na(activity))
```

2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.
3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

```{r}
# Loop thru all the rows of activity, find the one with NA for steps.For each identify the interval for that row
# Then identify the avg steps for that interval in avg_steps_per_interval. Substitute the NA value with that value
for (i in 1:nrow(activity)) {
    if(is.na(activity$steps[i])) {
        val <- avg_steps_interval$steps[which(avg_steps_interval$interval == activity$interval[i])]
        activity$steps[i] <- val 
    }
}
activity_imp <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activity, sum)

```

4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

```{r}
hist(activity_imp$steps, breaks = 25, main = "Histogram of total number of steps per day (IMPUTED)", xlab = "Steps per day")

mean(steps_per_day$steps)
median(steps_per_day$steps)
mean(activity_imp$steps)
median(activity_imp$steps)
```
Note that the median has changed and now equals the mean.

##Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
For this part the weekdays() function may be of some help here. Use the dataset with the filled-in missing values for this part.

1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels -- "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

2. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). 
```{r}
activity$day <- weekdays(activity$date)
activity$week <- ""
activity[activity$day == "zaterdag" | activity$day == "zondag", ]$week <- "weekend"
activity[!(activity$day == "zaterdag" | activity$day == "zondag"), ]$week <- "weekday"
activity$week <- factor(activity$week)
#Never mind the Dutch 'zaterdag' and 'zondag':)

library(lattice)
avg_step_imp <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + week, data = activity, mean)
xyplot(steps ~ interval | week, data = avg_step_imp, type = "l", lwd = 2,
       layout = c(1, 2), 
       xlab = "5-minute interval", 
       ylab = "Average number of steps",
       main = "Average Number of Steps taken (across all weekday days or weekend days)")

```
